Custom fields types for SqlAlchemy which integrated with Uploadcare service.

Installation
------------

.. code:: bash

    $ pip install pyuploadcare-sqlalchemy

Usage
-----

This package similar to ``pyuploadcare.dj`` but for ``Sqlalchemy`` instead of Django's ORM. It stores Uploadcare CDN links on database's side and builds a object of ``File`` (or ``FileGroup``) on python's side (e.g you can easily use it in yours templates).

Fields types:

* ``FileType``
* ``FileGroupType``
* ``ImageType`` - Provides syntax sugar when working with images - ``effects`` - you can set default effects according by `CDN API <https://uploadcare.com/documentation/cdn/#image-operations>`_ which will be applied to uploaded image.

Also for getting started you can look at this `simplest example <https://github.com/uploadcare/pyuploadcare-sqlalchemy/tree/master/example>`_.

For install it use a command:

.. code:: bash

    $ make run_example
